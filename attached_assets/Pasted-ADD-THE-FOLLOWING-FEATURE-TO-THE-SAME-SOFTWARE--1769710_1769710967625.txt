ADD THE FOLLOWING FEATURE TO THE SAME SOFTWARE:

--------------------------------------------------
MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT (INR AS BASE)
--------------------------------------------------

Business Rule:
- The company is an Indian agency.
- Base currency is INR.
- All accounting, profit/loss, balances, and reports must be calculated ONLY in INR.
- Other currencies (USD, etc.) are supported only for input and display.

Transaction Currency Logic:
Each transaction must store:
- original_amount
- original_currency (INR, USD, etc.)
- exchange_rate_to_inr
- amount_in_inr (calculated & stored)

Rules:
- If original_currency = INR:
  - exchange_rate_to_inr = 1
  - amount_in_inr = original_amount
- If original_currency ≠ INR:
  - System should auto-fetch exchange rate using a free public API
  - Admin can manually override the exchange rate
  - Converted INR value must be stored permanently
  - Historical transactions must NOT change if exchange rates change later

Reporting Rules:
- All calculations (income, expense, profit, balances) use amount_in_inr ONLY
- Default display currency is INR
- User can toggle display to USD for viewing purposes
- Display conversion must use stored exchange rate, not live rate

Opening Balance Rules:
- Opening balances are always stored in INR only
- Opening balance never counts as income or expense

Transfers:
- Transfers between accounts do not trigger currency conversion
- Transfers do not affect profit or loss

Invoices:
- Each client can have a preferred invoice currency
- Invoice currency can be USD or INR
- Internally, invoice values must still be stored in INR
- Payment received in foreign currency must convert to INR using rate at payment date

Permissions:
- Only Admin can:
  - Edit exchange rates
  - Change base currency settings
- Other roles can only view currency values

UI Requirements:
- Currency selector during transaction entry
- Clear display of:
  - Original amount & currency
  - Converted INR amount
- No complex forex terminology (keep it simple)

Important Constraints:
- Do NOT mix multiple currencies in totals
- Do NOT recalculate historical data using live rates
- Accuracy and consistency are more important than real-time forex precision
